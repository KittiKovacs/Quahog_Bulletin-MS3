# Quahog City Council Bulletin Board

## The Online Bulletin Board project of the fictional city of Quahog

The purpose of the project is to create an online platform for the citizens and the council to post ideas, announcements or advertisements to- much like a real-life bulletin board. 

My aim with the project is to create a full stack site that allows users to Create, Edit, Read and Delete data in a way that's easily manageable for all users as well as giving them a great user experience.

Please see the link to the live page below:


## UX

The main benefit for the user is that they can easily get involved and contribute to the life of their hometown. They can look for updates from the local council and start a conversation with them and other citizens; they can post private ads and invitations to events, clubs, goups and so on. They can offer and ask for help thereby strengthening the ties between the community members.

As a user who is in a hurry I want to be able to filter the posts in each category for certain keywords.

As a user who would like to get in touch with the Council directly I am interested in the contact details of the City hall.
